Phase 1: Backend Foundation (The Engine)
First, we will build the core logic on your server. This ensures that all subscription actions are handled securely and reliably.
1.	Automatic Free Plan for New Users:
•	When a new user registers, we will modify the registration process to automatically create a "Free" plan subscription for them in the database. This ensures every user starts on the correct plan.
2.	Smart Checkout Session Creation:
•	We will upgrade the existing 
createCheckoutSession function. It will now be smart enough to distinguish between:
•	A new upgrade: (e.g., Free to Essential or Premium)
•	A plan change: (e.g., Essential to Premium)
•	This function will correctly create the right kind of Stripe session, ensuring prorations are handled automatically when switching between paid plans.
3.	Graceful Cancellation and Downgrades to Free:
•	We will create a new, dedicated 
cancelSubscription function.
•	When a user downgrades to the "Free" plan, this function will tell Stripe to cancel their paid subscription at the end of the current billing period.
•	This is the standard, user-friendly approach: they get to use the features they paid for until the period ends, at which point they are automatically moved to the Free plan.
4.	Reliable Webhook Handling:
•	We will create a dedicated webhook endpoint to listen for real-time updates from Stripe. This is the most critical piece for a reliable system. It will handle events like 
checkout.session.completed  and customer.subscription.deleted  to ensure your database is always in perfect sync with Stripe, even if a user closes their browser window after paying.

Phase 2: Frontend Experience (The Controls)
Once the backend engine is built, we will connect it to the user interface.
1.	Dynamic Action Buttons:
•	We will make the buttons on your subscription page intelligent. They will dynamically change based on the user's current plan:
•	"Upgrade" will be shown for plans above the user's current one.
•	"Downgrade" will be shown for plans below the user's current one.
•	"Current Plan" will be shown for the plan they are currently on.
2.	Clear User Feedback:
•	The UI will provide clear feedback. For example, after a user cancels, it will display a message like, "Your Premium plan is active until [Date]. You will be switched to the Free plan after this."
